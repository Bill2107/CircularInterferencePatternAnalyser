# CircularInterferencePatternAnalyser
Spits out a radial intensity plot that w/ csv file that you can use for your analysis

# Installation:
Since I cant figure out to put installers on my git Ive just uploaded the source file here, effectively all you need to do to get this to work is to open up the source file in Matlabs App creator and run it from there.

Also feel free to edit the source as you feel fit, its definitely possible to get the findpeaks stuff working better to automate some of the signal analysis stuff, Ive just failed at getting it to work exactly as Id want so far.

# Application

Effectively as promised this will give you a radial intensity plot, also note the fact that you can limit the angle over which you sum the radial intensity. The point of this being that if your lenses are smudged or something this will allow you do get rid of the data that muddys the decomposition. Its not intended as a replacement for poor mirror allignment.
